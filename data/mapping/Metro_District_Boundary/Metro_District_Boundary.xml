            <abstract>The political boundary showing the area that is subject to Metro's regulatory and taxing authority and the area that has elected representation on the Metro Council.  The Oregon Legislature drew the Metro boundary that covers the Portland metropolitan area. Date of last data update: 2025-04-21 This is official RLIS data.

            <supplinf>The Metro district boundary serves as the agency''''s political boundary. Residents living inside the Metro boundary vote for representatives to the Metro Council, and their land is subject to Metro''''s regulatory and taxing authority. The Metro district boundary is different from the urban growth boundary. Some areas are inside the urban growth boundary but outside the Metro boundary, and some areas are inside the Metro boundary but outside the urban growth boundary. People who live inside the urban growth boundary but outside the Metro legal boundary are not subject to Metro taxes or regulation. They are not represented on the Metro Council, nor can they vote in Metro elections.
