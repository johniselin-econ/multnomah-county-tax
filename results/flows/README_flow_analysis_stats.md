# Flow Analysis Statistics Documentation

**File:** `flow_analysis_stats.xlsx`
**Generated by:** `code/02_flow_analysis.do`
**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

This Excel file contains summary statistics from a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis of migration flows to and from Multnomah County, Oregon following the implementation of a local tax policy (post-2020). The analysis uses IRS county-to-county migration flow data.

The file contains **two sheets**:
- **all**: Results using all U.S. counties (excluding Alaska and Hawaii)
- **acs**: Results restricted to counties with ACS data coverage, which allows for property tax rate controls

## Methodology

The underlying regression model is a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) specification with high-dimensional fixed effects:

```
ppmlhdfe outcome i.out_county_post i.in_county_post [covariates], absorb(year flow_id) vce(cluster flow_id)
```

Where:
- **outcome**: AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) for the permutation analysis
- **out_county_post**: Interaction of out-migration from county × post-2020 indicator
- **in_county_post**: Interaction of in-migration to county × post-2020 indicator
- **flow_id**: Origin-destination county pair fixed effect
- **year**: Year fixed effect

**Covariates** (sample-dependent):
- All sample: unemployment rate, population, per capita income (origin and destination)
- ACS sample: Above plus property tax rates (origin and destination)

## Statistics Dictionary

### Multnomah County Statistics

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `m_b_out` | Multnomah out-migration coefficient from DiD regression. Represents the change in out-migration from Multnomah County after 2020 relative to control counties. |
| `m_se_out` | Standard error of the out-migration coefficient (clustered at flow level). |
| `m_t_out` | T-statistic for out-migration coefficient (`m_b_out / m_se_out`). |
| `m_p_out` | Two-sided p-value for out-migration coefficient, calculated as `2 * (1 - Φ(\|t\|))`. |
| `m_pctile_out` | Percentile rank of Multnomah's out-migration coefficient relative to all other counties (0-100 scale). |
| `m_b_in` | Multnomah in-migration coefficient from DiD regression. Represents the change in in-migration to Multnomah County after 2020 relative to control counties. |
| `m_se_in` | Standard error of the in-migration coefficient (clustered at flow level). |
| `m_t_in` | T-statistic for in-migration coefficient (`m_b_in / m_se_in`). |
| `m_p_in` | Two-sided p-value for in-migration coefficient. |
| `m_pctile_in` | Percentile rank of Multnomah's in-migration coefficient relative to all other counties (0-100 scale). |

### Count Statistics

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `n_counties_out` | Total number of counties with non-missing out-migration coefficients (i.e., successful regression convergence). |
| `n_counties_in` | Total number of counties with non-missing in-migration coefficients. |
| `n_counties_both` | Number of counties with both out- and in-migration coefficients available. |
| `n_larger_out` | Count of counties with a **larger** (more positive) out-migration coefficient than Multnomah. A larger out-migration coefficient indicates greater increase in out-migration post-treatment. |
| `n_larger_out_sig` | Count of counties with larger out-migration coefficient than Multnomah **and** statistically significant at p < 0.05. |
| `n_smaller_in` | Count of counties with a **smaller** (more negative) in-migration coefficient than Multnomah. A smaller in-migration coefficient indicates greater decrease in in-migration post-treatment. |
| `n_smaller_in_sig` | Count of counties with smaller in-migration coefficient than Multnomah **and** statistically significant at p < 0.05. |
| `n_worse_both` | Count of counties that are "worse" than Multnomah on **both** dimensions: larger out-migration coefficient AND smaller in-migration coefficient. |
| `n_worse_both_sig` | Count of counties worse on both dimensions where **both** coefficients are statistically significant at p < 0.05. |

### Distribution Statistics: Out-Migration Coefficients

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `dist_out_mean` | Mean of out-migration coefficients across all counties. |
| `dist_out_sd` | Standard deviation of out-migration coefficients across all counties. |
| `dist_out_min` | Minimum out-migration coefficient observed. |
| `dist_out_max` | Maximum out-migration coefficient observed. |
| `dist_out_p25` | 25th percentile of out-migration coefficient distribution. |
| `dist_out_p50` | Median (50th percentile) of out-migration coefficient distribution. |
| `dist_out_p75` | 75th percentile of out-migration coefficient distribution. |

### Distribution Statistics: In-Migration Coefficients

## Interpretation Guide

### Coefficient Signs
- **Positive out-migration coefficient**: Increase in out-migration from the county after 2020
- **Negative out-migration coefficient**: Decrease in out-migration from the county after 2020
- **Positive in-migration coefficient**: Increase in in-migration to the county after 2020
- **Negative in-migration coefficient**: Decrease in in-migration to the county after 2020

### Percentile Ranks
- Higher percentile for out-migration = more counties had smaller (less positive) out-migration effects
- Higher percentile for in-migration = more counties had smaller (less positive) in-migration effects

### "Worse" Definition
A county is considered to have "worse" migration outcomes than Multnomah if it experienced:
1. Greater increase in out-migration (larger positive coefficient), AND
2. Greater decrease in in-migration (smaller/more negative coefficient)

## Sample Differences

| Feature | `all` sheet | `acs` sheet |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Sample | All continental U.S. counties | Counties observed in ACS data (2013-2022) |
| Property tax controls | No | Yes (`prop_rate_mean_o`, `prop_rate_mean_d`) |
| Use case | Broader comparison | More controlled comparison with property tax adjustment |
